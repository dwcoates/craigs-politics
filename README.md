A bit of analysis on craigslist trends

A little program for extracting some CL posts on the politics board, then some
analysis on that. For the discussion on the data, see the pdf, [politics.pdf](./politics.pdf), or view [the html](https://cdn.rawgit.com/dwcoates/craigs-politics/4ae4c4b3/politics.html) 
(that site for some reason fails to render the syntax highlighting). The .org, .html,
and .py and .pdf files are all formats for the same document.
