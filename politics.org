* Introduction
For my web scraping project, I've chosen to extract some of the politics data
from craigslist.org. My original ambition, though it proved difficult to affirm,
was to prove a small, non-existant, or negative correllation of pro-trump
chatter to expected conservatism. That is, I suspected that, somewhat
counter-intuitively, the politics sections of more conservative states would a
disproportionately less likely source of pro-trump posts. My basis for this
suspicion was my general observation that less regulated areas for discussion on
the internet tend to be very attractive to those members of a publically
socially disparaged minority. Recognizing that, among other clues, Trump
supporters in largely pro-Clinton geographic areas are disparaged for their
support in amounts disproportionate to their surprisingly high representation,
it followed that I could expect a surprising amount of pro-Trump (mostly
trollish) chatter in mostly liberal places (e.g., New York City). The positive
sentiment aspect of that hypothesis proved to be difficult to convincingly
affirm. More generally, also I sought to analyze the trends of politcs
discussion of craiglist, mostly in the area of text usage (capitalization, word
frequency, etc) vs political leaning.

* Methodology
To extract data from craigslist, I used the Python Scrapy package, which was
probably overkill. Originally, I intended to collect post bodies as well as the
titles, however this would require about 100 times as many request, too many for
me to reponsibly execute in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, I limited
the extractor to titles, which involved about 500 requests, spread over 5 hours,
to obtain roughly 40,000 posts titles/times. For each of these titles, there is
a corresponding state and region, with some regions additionally divided into
subregions (the New York City region, for example, consists of Brooklyn, Queens,
Manhattan, etc). Each post, its time and its geographical origin are represented
with a single row in a 40k row Pandas ~DataFrame~ (DF), ~usa~. Data corruption was
not an issue, as the CL layout is quite uniform, though I did need to take into
account data redundancy (e.g., occaisionally "regions" are also "subregions" of
sibling regions), and was able to handle this by ensuring links were travelled
to only once. To make use of the extracted post title data, I employed the 2010
U.S. census, which is available from http://www.census.gov, as well as the 2016
election results data, which I scraped from http://uselectionatlas.org/ using a
BeautifulSoup extraction script.

* Preparing data
** TODO Craigcrawler :ignore:
The [[https://github.com/dwcoates/craigs-politics/tree/master/craigcrawler][craigslist extractor]], written as a scrapy program, collected
titles and dates, as well as the corresponding geographical
designations. To keep it simple, these are all stored together as rows
in a csv file.

** Preprocess Data
A small bit of preprocessing to check data for corruption and unexpected results
was necessary. There was no missing data, and no corruption. I suspected that I
might encounter some amount of redundancy, but the extractor was written to
exclude duplicated links, and it happened to be the case that CL keys areas
uniquely across highly related (sub)regions. For example, the "long island"
/region/ and "long island, NY" /subregion/ (subregion of "new york city" region)
seem like they might be the same, but are actually completely distinct.

* State Usage
** intro :ignore:
Although the post data has attached a fairly fine-grain geographical
description, I found the CL regions in general to not line up well with any
census bureau categories. Moreover, even in the lucky event of such name
correspondence, the division of regions was at least questionable. For example,
by far the dataset's most prominent "state" outliers, District of Columbia, has
a census population of about 600k, yet a practical metropolitan area population
in the several millions, a disparity that grossly skews its contributions to
state-wide political statistics. For this reason, regions and subregions were
largely found to be unmanageably tedious to consider seriously in any
analysis. States, however, having relatively little variation between practical
occupancy and census population, and having indisputable borders, barring District
of Columbia, are ideal for inspection.
** Terms
1. *Patronage*
   Patronage is the raw number of posts on a politics board.
2. *Usage*
   Usage is my measure for a states proportional interest in the
   politics board. It is simply the normalized ratio of patronage and
   state population.
3. *Trumpism*
   Trumpism is the name for a state's Republican vote percentage in the
   General Election. It is used as a rough measure of how pro-Trump
   a given stat is, and is a column in the ~voting~ DataFrame,
   which is comprised of scraped data on the 2016 General Election
   results.

** Outliers
There are two major outlying states in the dataset: /Colorodo/ and
/District of Columbia/.
*** Colorodo
We can see from the following that Colorado is an extreme outlier,
being the fifth most popular state, yet the 23rd most populous.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :file ./img/py6320WCb.png :exports results

ax2 = ax.twinx() # Create another axes that shares the same x-axis as ax.

width = 0.2

top_five.patronage.plot(kind='bar', color='#992255', ax=ax, width=width, position=1)
top_five.population.plot(kind='bar', color='#CC7733', ax=ax2, width=width, position=0)

ax.set_ylabel('Patronage')
ax2.set_ylabel('Population')

plt.show()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/py6320WCb.png]]

With the normalized population/patronage ratio depicted above, we derive the
/usage/ metric, for which the median is 0.203, and for which the state with the
next highest popularity, Hawaii, is rated 0.816.

Usage in the Denver region is also especially large. Despite having a population
of 650,000 people (and a metropolitcan area of 3 million), Denver sees a
large patronage:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output raw drawer :noweb yes  :exports none
print("Patronage of Denver, Colorado: {}".format(len(usa[usa.region == "denver, CO"])))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Patronage of Denver, Colorado: 1187
:END:

For the reasons mentioned before, deriving state usage measurements for regions
and subregions is too difficult to bother with. However, we can get a feeling
for this anomoly by comparing it to another region, "new york city". The "new
york city" region, which is expansive enough as to include metropolitan areas
like "new jersey", "long island", "fairfield", etc, has /significantly/ /fewer/
posts for the week of data extracted, at 1006 posts:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :noweb yes :exports code :results code

1006 posts in NYC spread over:
manhattan,
brooklyn,
queens,
bronx,
staten island,
new jersey,
long island,
westchester,
and fairfield.

Considering city propers, we can say that Denver has ~15.5x the usage rate of 
New York City. Adjusting for census estimates for metropolitan areas, it would 
seem that Denver's usage is ~8.5x that of NYC's.
#+END_SRC

This is a remarkably popular region, clearly. I suspect that this extreme usage
rate has to do with the state granularity CL assigned to the state of
Colorado. They might want to consider providing more regions. However, we also
see that the usage of the Denver metropolitan area is proportionally less
extreme compared to NYC's metropolitan area usage, which might cast some doubt
on how much Denver needs more division among it's subregions. Suffice it to say,
Denver is wildly popular for CL politics.
*** District of Columbia
While I found Colorado to be an inexplicable anamoly, it was also justifiably
accurate. District of Columbia, having an incredibly low Republican voting rate
of ~4%, and the usage similar to Colorado's, coupled with it's unclear
geographic distinction and population, meant its results were too extreme and
variable to consider in analysis. Besides, it's not even a real state...

Seemingly some correlation between low population and low usage is
evident. However, the states for which the politics board is most popular are
also fairly small. It may be that the popularity doesn't relate to state size,
directly, but to political orientation, which itself correlates with state
population (states are smaller in Middle America). I suspect that political
discussion is most charged currently in Democratic states, where discenting
opinion is that which is held by the triumphant party. It may also be that the board
popularity relationship to patronage is non-linear. This correlation is explored
more by some political investigation.

These are the PDF estimations for normalized patronage, population, usage. They
are estimations, so they extend beyond 0 and 1 on the graph. Usage distribution
is the ratio distribution of patronage and population.

We can see that usage has less variance than patronage and population,
which we should expect. Perhaps it is somewhat more than expected,
however.

:END:

Here we can see illustrated what's been already hinted at: the states with the
most and least usage are generally less populated and less patronaged, and, of
course, there is a tight correlation between patronage and population. In the
graph, redness relates to usage positively. The most red and most yellow dots
are all in the least populated states/least patroned boards. We also see that
generally, states that see more posts also tend to have higher usage.

My speculation is that activity on a social board, to a point,
disproportionately encourages more activity. That is, if having more posts to
look at means also a greater liklihood that a viewer will be inspired to make a
post of their own, then the relationship between the raw number of posts on a
message board and the number of prospective posters (which I'm supposing is
proportional to state population) is greater than linear. That is, fewer posts
means you, as a spectator, will be less likely to feel a desire to post, and
therefore, a message board with few posts will see fewer new posts than a
message board with many posts.
** Politics
*** Posts over Trumpism  :ignore:
It seems that the distribution of posts is weighted on the Democrat's
side of the spectrum:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :file ./img/py22415X0p.png :exports results
  post_politics = usa.join(states.trumpism, how="outer", on="state")
  post_politics.trumpism.plot(kind="hist", bins=20, color=["#FF9911"], 
                              title="Distribution of posts by politics")
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/py22415X0p.png]]

However, Democratic registration outweighs Rebpublican voting rates
slightly. We can visualize this preference a bit differently by
finding the average post trumpism, and comparing it to national voting
trends:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports code :results none
  avg_post_trumpism = post_politics.trumpism.mean()
  trump_votes = voting.trump.sum()
  clinton_votes = voting.clinton.sum()
  national_trumpism = trump_votes/float((trump_votes + clinton_votes))
#+END_SRC

It's a bit more clear here that the skew of trumpism distribution is weighted a
bit on the left, though the mean is quite close to what's expected, at about 48%
of Trump+Clinton votes. The skewness of distribution is expected, and in line
with my original hypothesis. In general, it would seem the most divided states
see the most traffic, with less divided states being prominently Democratic. The
mean in preserved by what seems to be in states that Trump won by a relatively
small margin.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports results :results org output 
  # Some printing
  print(("Mean trumpism: {:.2f} Trump voters seem to show " + 
         "{:+.2f}% representation\non CL politics vs General " + 
         "Election results.").format(
             (avg_post_trumpism*100), 
             (avg_post_trumpism/national_trumpism)*100-100))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
Mean trumpism: 48.42 Trump voters seem to show -1.17% representation
on CL politics vs General Election results.
#+END_SRC

An alternative representation that may make this skew a bit more apparent:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :file ./img/py26878eDX.png :exports results 
  post_trumpism_tot = post_politics.trumpism.plot(
      kind="density", 
      title="PDF estimation of Trumpism w/ mean",
      sharey=True)
  plt.axvline(post_politics.trumpism.mean(), color='r', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=.5)
  #+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/py26878eDX.png]]
*** Usage vs Trumpism
We can see the correlations between patronage, population, and usage,
here. We of course expect correlation between patronage and population
to be quite high: states with more people generally have more
posts. Below, positive correlation is pictured by redness, while
negative is pictures by blueness. Darkness visualizes closeness.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :file ./img/py2241F8fd.png :exports results
  corr = states.filter(["patronage", "usage", "trumpism", "population"]).corr()
  fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4))
  ax.matshow(corr, cmap=plt.cm.seismic)
  plt.xticks(range(len(corr.columns)), corr.columns);
  plt.yticks(range(len(corr.columns)), corr.columns);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/py2241F8fd.png]]

Note the correlation between trumpism and usage. Also, the correlation
between patronage and usage coincides with how you'd expect boards
with the least diversity to be disproportionately unfrequented. Boards
with few posts become ghost towns. Here are the pearson correlation
numbers behinds the colors:

Looking at general word usage, we see how often President Obama and President
Trump are discussed. Note that "hillary" and "clinton" are surprisingly not
mentioned as much as you might think. "Clinton", in fact, is mentioned less
freqeuntly than "Donald". It may be that a month after the election, "hillary"
talk has already begun to significantly subside. It's impossible to know for
sure, as CL does not hold on to their posts for longer than a week.

*** Unicode
I was curious about non-ascii usage, and so I used the following code to grab
them:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports code
def check_ascii(post):
    """
    Determines whether a title is encodable as ascii
    """
    try:
        post.encode('ascii')
        return True
    except UnicodeError:
        return False
ascii_posts = usa[usa.title.apply(check_ascii)]
nonascii_posts = usa[~usa.title.apply(check_ascii)]
distinct_states = nonascii_posts["state"].unique()
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
The number of posts containing non-ascii characters was surprisingly small:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session   :exports results :results output org :noweb yes
print ("{0:,} of {1:,} total posts were non-ascii ({2:.2f}%), confined to {3} "
       + "states.").format(len(nonascii_posts),
                       len(usa),
                       len(nonascii_posts)/float(len(usa)) * 100,
                       len(distinct_states))
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
219 of 38,324 total posts were non-ascii (0.57%), confined to 22 states.
#+END_SRC
We can look at the main outlier for the posts by checking out Pennsylvania:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session  :exports code :tangle ./politics.py
  pennsylvania = nonascii_posts[nonascii_posts["state"] == "Pennsylvania"]
  pennsylvania.groupby("region").count()
  penn_lenn = float(len(pennsylvania.title))
  post_uniqueness = (penn_lenn-pennsylvania.title.nunique())/penn_lenn * 100
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
We can use a SequenceMatcher to test the similarity of the strings in the pool:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session  :exports code
  import itertools
  from difflib import SequenceMatcher
  def avg_similarity(posts):
    def similarity(a, b):
      return SequenceMatcher(None, a, b).ratio()
    sim_sum = 0
    title_product = itertools.product(posts.title, posts.title)
    for title_pair in title_product:
      sim_sum += similarity(*title_pair)
    avg_sim = sim_sum/(len(posts)**2)
    return avg_sim
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
Running this over all non-ascii posts to get an idea of how much silliness is
going on with these posts:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports results :results output org :noweb yes 
    print(("The average similarity of all non-ascii posts is " +
           "{:.2f}, while that \nof only those in Pennsylvania is " +
           "{:.2f}. The average for all posts in\nall regions is " +
           "{:.2f}.")).format(avg_similarity(nonascii_posts),
                              avg_similarity(pennsylvania),
                              avg_similarity(usa.sample(200)))
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS[2f3dffa2f757c0a80e292c245bfdb5a8afb660a0]:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
The average similarity of all non-ascii posts is 0.19 while that 
of only those in Pennsylvania is 0.38. The average for all posts in
all regions is 0.19.
#+END_SRC
It would therefore seem that a single Trump memester, making use of a
handful of unicode symbols, is responsible for this chaos in
Pennsylvania. I suspect that these crazy unicode posts are mostly
done by a very small set of people in general, though there is no
good way to tell, as CL is completely anonymous.

However, Democratic states seem to have relatively strong preferance
for using "TRUMP" versus "Trump". Below's graph depicts this skew,
which is made more noticible by the considerable left-shift of the
mean:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :file ./img/py26878b0D.png :exports results

It isn't clear why there seems to be preference for capitalization of
"TRUMP" among Dem states; are they mostly angry and disparaging,
supportive, or a bit of both? Some random sampling of particularly
liberal states might provide some clues:

*** "liberal" vs "conservative"
**** *Usage*
"liberal" is used far more often than "conservative". The pluralizations,
respectively, are comparitively not quite as distinguished, but still quite
different.  Below are the instance rate ratios of "liberal" and "conservative"
in their various forms.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports results :results output org :noweb yes
  liberal = float(posts_corpus["liberal"])
  liberal_p = float(posts_corpus["liberals"])
  conserv = float(posts_corpus["conservative"])
  conserv_p = float(posts_corpus["conservatives"])

  print ("liberal/conservative: {0:.2f}\n" +
         "liberals/conservatives: {1:.2f}\n" +
         "liberal(s)/conservative(s): {2:.2f}" +
         "") .format(liberal/conserv,
                     liberal_p/conserv_p,
                     (liberal+liberal_p)/(conserv+conserv_p))

#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:

#+END_SRC

**** *Pluralization*
The singular version of "conservative" is used a bit more than half as much as
the pluralization. By contrast, the singular version of "liberal" is used more
than twice as much as the pluralization:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports results :results output org :noweb yes
  print("*singular/plural*\n" +
        "'conservative': {0:.3f}\n" +

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC org

'liberal': 2.198
#+END_SRC

**** *Capitalization*
We here see that there is a great preference for capitalization of "liberal"
vs. "conservative". "'liberal' preference" refers to the capitalization rates of
"liberal"/"conservative".
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports code
  libs = eval_strs("liberal").sum(numeric_only=True)
  conservs = eval_strs("conservative").sum(numeric_only=True)

*** Semantics
I figured that a natural way to go about investigating sentiment would be
semantic analysis. I quickly decided that this was, with it's present
implementation at least, not the way to go about it. The following code will run
semantic analysis using the popular NLTK package. The results are as dubious as
my implementation.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports code 
  from textblob import TextBlob

  def semants(text):
      blob = TextBlob(text)
      ss = 0
      for sentence in blob.sentences:
          ss += sentence.sentiment.polarity
      return float(ss)/len(blob.sentences)

  # package does not like non-ascii encodings
  trumps_ascii = trumps[trumps["*trump*"].apply(check_ascii)]


  usa_sentiment = post_politics.join(ascii_posts.title.apply(
      semants).rename("sentiment"))
  trumps_sentiment = usa_sentiment.filter(trumps_ascii.index, axis=0)

* Conclusion
The distribution posts and the favor of those posts across the politics sections
is somewhat surprising. Denver, Colorado, was a perplexing result. I suspect that this is evidence of cultural
normalization in the face of resistance+anonimity: faceless, nameless
interaction coupled with outspokenness against relatively strict local social
norms. This has proven more difficult to prove than I initially suspected. While
any amount of ransom sampling of the posts allows me to be confident in this
theory, convincing proof would most likely involve a tedious, exhausive effort.

* Notes about this document
This document is, in its original form, an emacs org-mode
organizational markup document that supports interactive programming
and exporting quite thoroughly. It exports to a variety of formats
(html, latex, markdown, etc), and in this case, was exported directly
to html. It's quite powerful, and allows me to tailor what headers are
exported, what code is exported, what code results, to what
interpreter the code talks, how it's formated, etc. The original
document, if viewed in org-mode in emacs, is quite a bit larger,
containing all of the code used for the project, most of which is not
shown in markdown exports. Therefore, if you view this document on
github, you will see a truncated version much like the version you are
likely viewing now. You can view on github, a .ipynb and a .py export
are available for the complete code of the document. Obviously, they
won't include the organization and commentary. You can look at the raw
contents of the .org file if curious (github will export primitively
to html by default for display), or check out this [[http://kozikow.com/2016/05/21/very-powerful-data-analysis-environment-org-mode-with-ob-ipython/comment-page-1/#comment-240][blog on interactive
